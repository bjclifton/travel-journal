## Description

This project is a Travel Journal app created using React. The app serves as a platform to record and showcase travel experiences. It involves importing data from a JSON file and dynamically displaying it in cards on the screen. While not part of The Odin Project curriculum, this project was completed to practice working with data in JSON format, creating responsive layouts, and enhancing my React skills.

The app allows users to view and explore travel experiences through user-friendly cards, each containing relevant information and images.
